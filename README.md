# Project-2

Imagine you are enrolled in some branch of the US military and you have to change bases every two to four years. You accumulate things through those years and then realize that you cannot take everything with you to the next base. Your options would be to tell your friends and hope they need some of your items, use some existing website like craigslist and meet with (sometimes very creepy) strangers, or just give away your stuff.  

The Military Marketplace is a website that lets military members post their items on a platform that can be seen by the rest of the military community. The advantage that this has over other websites is the fact that the encounters and deals are accorded between members of the very close knit military community. This is not only a way to get rid of your stuff but it is also an excelent way to network.
